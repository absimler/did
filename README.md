# Lectures 17-18: Difference-in-differences in action: BIOL 597

## The "wildlife" dataset in this repository contains information about the average number of wildlife collisions/year before (in 2020) and after (in 2022) corridors were installed in the study region. Collisions were recorded at 100 different sites. The dataset contains the following variables:
## corridor = whether or not a site received a corridor (1=treated) or not (0=untreated).
## collisions = the number of collisions per year per 1 km segment
## roads = the mean WIDTH of the road at each site. This variable is time-invariant.
## protectarea = the percentage of the area around each site (500m radius) that is designated as "protected" area (e.g. state, federal, or local level)
## humans = the density of human population (people/km^2) in the area (500m radius) surrounding the site
## year = whether the observation was before (2020) or after (2022) corridors were built.
